# Kaggle Competition Submission - Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets 

## Team Members:
- Atul Parida

## Competition Overview:
Welcome to my submission for the "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" competition on Kaggle. In this competition, the goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether tweets are about real disasters or not. This is a binary classification task that is perfect for those looking to get started with Natural Language Processing.

## Data:
- I have used the provided dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand-classified.
- The dataset contains both text data and labels indicating whether each tweet is describing a real disaster (1) or not (0).

## Approach:
- I began by exploring and visualizing the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of real disaster and non-disaster tweets.
- Preprocessing steps included text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using techniques such as TF-IDF.
- We experimented with various machine learning algorithms and NLP models, including but not limited to Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and BERT.
- Model hyperparameters were tuned using cross-validation and grid search.
- I evaluated the models based on F1 score as specified in the competition evaluation criteria.

## Code:
- You can find my code for this competition in the Kaggle Notebooks associated with this submission.

## Models:
- I have trained multiple models and fine-tuned them for performance.
- The best-performing model is named [Model Name] and achieved an F1 score of [F1 Score] on the test data.

## Results:
- The final submission achieved an F1 score of [Final F1 Score] on the test set.

## Conclusion:
- I had a great learning experience participating in this competition, and it was a fantastic opportunity to apply NLP techniques to a real-world problem.
- I want to express my gratitude to Kaggle for hosting this competition.

## How to Replicate Our Submission:
- You can replicate our results by following the code available in our Kaggle Notebooks.

## Acknowledgments:
- I would like to thank Kaggle and the competition hosts for providing the dataset and the platform for this competition.
