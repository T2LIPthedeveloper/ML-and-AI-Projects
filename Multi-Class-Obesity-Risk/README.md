# Kaggle Competition Submission - Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk (TensorFlow, Keras)

## Team Members: Atul Parida

## Competition Overview:
- The purpose of the competition is to use binary classification to predict obesity risk in individuals, which is related to cardiovascular disease..

## Data:
- I have used the provided dataset of 4,200 rows and their corresponding labels.
- The dataset contains 37 columns of numerical and categorical features relating to obesity-realted bio-signals.

## Approach:
- I began by doing minimal exploration and visualisation of the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of elements per class.
- As the dataset is relatively clean with no missing elements and very little collinearity observed between features, not much preprocessing needed to be conducted aside from feature normalization.
- I evaluated the models based on accuracy as specified in the competition evaluation criteria, and chose to use ensembles.

## Code:
- You can find my code for this competition in the notebook titled ```submission_v1.ipynb``` associated with this repository.

## Results:
- The final submission achieved an accuracy of ```0.88150``` on the test set.
- I had a great learning experience participating in this competition, and it was a good opportunity to apply basic ML techniques to a public dataset.
- I would like to express my gratitude to the competition hosts for providing the dataset and the platform for this competition.

## How to Replicate My Submission:
- You can replicate my results by following the code available in the repository's .ipynb notebook.


## Acknowledgements:
- I would like to thank Kaggle for providing the dataset and the platform for this competition.
